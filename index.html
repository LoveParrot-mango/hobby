                <p> Dancing has been my hobby from the age of 8. I always do it in my leisure time, however, because of the pandemic, I read and do crochet more. I used to go to Bhangra Classes but now, I can't go anymore. However, don't think I stopped doing it because now, I choreograph my own songs! Moreover, bhangra has encouraged me to listen to more punjabi songs and it just went on and on, till I started picking the songs and making my own dance on them. I have even performed on 2 parties with my sister and everyone loved it. Once, I had a practive video on my phone and my dad posted it on our family whatsapp group. It was really embarassing but I got a lot of compliments. This also made me learn Gidha, which is a girl dance. I am still practicing it. I hope you learned about one of my hobby! I would love to learn about yours! </p>
